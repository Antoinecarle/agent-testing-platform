# Copywriting & UX Writing

## Overview

Professional copywriting patterns for web interfaces, landing pages, marketing emails, and product UI. Focus on clear, compelling, conversion-driven text.

## Core Principles

1. **Clarity over cleverness** — Users scan, they don't read
2. **Benefits over features** — "Save 2 hours/day" not "Automated workflow engine"
3. **Active voice** — "We build" not "It is built by us"
4. **Specificity** — "12,000 teams" not "thousands of teams"
5. **One CTA per section** — Don't compete for attention

## Headline Formulas

### Value Proposition
```
[Verb] + [Outcome] + [Timeframe/Qualifier]
→ "Ship features 3x faster with AI-powered development"
```

### Problem-Solution
```
[Pain point]? + [Solution statement]
→ "Tired of slow deployments? Deploy in seconds, not hours."
```

### Social Proof
```
[Number] + [Users/Companies] + [Action/Result]
→ "Join 50,000+ developers who deploy with confidence"
```

### How-To
```
How to [achieve outcome] + [without pain point]
→ "How to scale your API without rewriting your backend"
```

## CTA Buttons

### Do
- "Start free trial" (specific action)
- "Get started — it's free" (remove friction)
- "See it in action" (low commitment)
- "Deploy now" (urgent, action-oriented)

### Don't
- "Submit" (generic)
- "Click here" (meaningless)
- "Learn more" (overused, vague)
- "Sign up" (implies commitment)

## UX Microcopy

### Error Messages
```
Bad:  "Error 400: Invalid request"
Good: "That email address doesn't look right. Check for typos?"
```

### Empty States
```
Bad:  "No data available"
Good: "No projects yet. Create your first one to get started."
```

### Loading States
```
Bad:  "Loading..."
Good: "Setting up your workspace..." (specific)
```

### Success Messages
```
Bad:  "Success"
Good: "Project created! You can start adding team members."
```

## Tone Guidelines

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| Onboarding | Warm, encouraging | "Welcome! Let's set up your first project." |
| Error | Helpful, calm | "Something went wrong. Try refreshing the page." |
| Success | Positive, brief | "Saved!" or "Done! Your changes are live." |
| Pricing | Confident, transparent | "Simple pricing. No hidden fees." |
| Legal | Clear, plain language | "We don't sell your data. Ever." |
