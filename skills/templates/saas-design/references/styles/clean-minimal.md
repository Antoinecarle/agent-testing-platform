## Typography

- Display: Inter, -apple-system, sans-serif
- Mono: JetBrains Mono, Fira Code, monospace
- Weights: 400 (body), 500 (labels), 600 (headings), 700 (display)

## Key Patterns

- Surfaces layer with subtle opacity differences, never hard color boundaries
- Borders are always rgba with low opacity (0.06-0.15)
- Hover states lighten by 4-8% opacity
- Active states use primary color at 10-15% opacity as background
